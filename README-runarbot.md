3. In the Configuration dialog enter the following hosting URL: `https://runarbot.azurewebsites.net/api/messages`
4. Click on the *Create Microsoft App ID and Password*, login to the App Dev portal and then click on the button to generate the App password. Save the generated password and the App ID to a secure location. Once done, click on the button to go back to the Bot Framework portal.

6. On the next page, choose to add the Microsoft Teams channel

In order to have one on one chats with the bot you also need to publish it, or you need to search for the bot using the id.

## How to configure the bot

The App Id and App Secret, generated during the registration, for the bot are read from the `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` and `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD` environment variables. These can be configured in the Azure Web App under *Application Settings > App Settings* 

## How to test the bot locally

The bot can be tested and debugged locally using the `gulp serve` command and using the _Microsoft Bot Framework Channel Emulator_.
